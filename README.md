# MethylationGE
DNA 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation are prevalent modifications in eukaryotic species. Recent studies have explored their crosstalk and impact on transcription. However, the intricate relationships among 5mC, m6A, and gene expression (GE) remain incompletely elucidated. Here, we collected data on 5mC, m6A, and GE from 24 samples comprising three tissues (caruncle, mammary, and spleen) from each of four pregnant cattle and sheep. We constructed a comprehensive genome-wide self-interaction (same gene) and across-interaction (across genes) network of 5mC and m6A within gene-bodies or promoters and GE in both species. Results suggest that RNA methylation has a stronger effect on GE than DNA methylation within gene-bodies and promoters, with a significant positive association. DNA and RNA methylation in gene-bodies had a greater impact on GE than those in promoters. These findings deepen comprehension of the dynamics and complex relationships among the epigenome, epitranscriptome, and transcriptome, offering fresh insights for advancing epigenetics research.
